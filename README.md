# lookingforraid.io

Customizable recruitment alerter that notifies World of Warcraft guilds whenever a player is looking for a new guild.
<br />
<br />
It scrapes the web to find new players, and then uses OAuth2 to send a message to the given Discord channel, based on certain business logic. Each message contains relevant stats and info about each player, sourced from different public and private APIs.
<br />
<br />
The application is hosted in AWS and uses DynamoDB to store data about guilds and players.
